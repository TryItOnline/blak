  BLAK 1.0     - http://exoprog.110mb.com
-------------------------------------------

  This is an interpreter for BLACK programming language.
  It is distributed under the terms of GNU GPL license, without
  ANY WARRANTY - see COPYING file.  
  
  I wrote this interpreter as a research tool.
  
  The Black is a two-dimensional esoteric programming language 
  created in 2006 by ais523.  See BLACK entry in Esoteric Language WIKI 
  (http://esolangs.org/wiki/Black) for detailed definition.
 
  The interpreter reads Black program from the file and interpretes it.
  The "arena" is large, but not infinite - it is limited by sizeof int
  verticaly and horizontaly. Fill free to change it to "long long" 
  and recompile. Number of filled cells is limited by your memory.
 
  BLAK interpreter has following features:
  1) The pointer characters (v, >, < or ^) can be used in source file
     to indicate starting point of the program other than standard.
  2) The TAB characters in source are treated as error, unless you
     give -t option
  3) Some command line options supporting debugging
  4) Numerical data dump
  5) Printing extensions (digits print themselves, N breaks line) 
  6) Memory is allocated only while reading the file - in runtime
     the interpreter maintains list of cells and does not allocate
     sigle byte of core.
    
  The debugging options are on, so if you want to run larger program
  and see the result, turn them off - use something like this:

       $> ./blak -e0 counters.n

  and you should see this:

  11111111111111111111111111
  111111111111111111111111111
  1111111111111111111111111111
  11111111111111111111111111111

  filling slower and slower your console ...

     
  The *.n files are some Black examples.  I call them *.n because 
  the first version of the program was called "noir".
